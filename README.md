It's just a simple Python practice exercise issued as part of a software development course.

As usual, see `task.md` for the instructions provided with the lab and `startpoint` for the files we were told to work from.

# OK but what is it doing?

Nothing fancy, it's just a bunch of functions and unit tests. You can run `run_tests.py` from a terminal if you want to check that all the tests pass.
